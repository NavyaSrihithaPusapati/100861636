Assignment-5
The end objective of the uploaded document was to use machine learning models- Support Vector Machine model and Naive Bayes model for the given data to find out ' Class' variable.

Firstly, I imported required python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to run the code
Then, loaded the dataset and called the function-'describe' to describe the variables through different mean and quartiles.
Next, I tried to present the correlation through a heatmap. I have given the code for the same by using Purple color. 
Then, I tried to visualize the same heatmap in terms of a pairplot- the numbers called through heatmap is now shown through a plot/graph.
I trained and tested both dependant and independant variables to understand their impact
Then, I have given the code for both SVM and Naive Bayes models for the model to run and give the final output.
The final output was displayed with all the model metrics-Precision, Recall, F1 and Support which explained a lot about the accuracy of the model.
